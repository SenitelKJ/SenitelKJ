Hi There! This repository showcases a selection of projects I've developed, demonstrating my skills in **full stack development**, **artificial intelligence**, and my on-going learning process.

## Perth Beaches
> Perth Beaches provides a live web dashboard for monitoring weather conditions and foot-traffic for various beaches around Perth, Western Australia. It's a full-stack application composed of a web scraper, a Flask backend API, a PostgreSQL database, a Next.js frontend, and hosted on AWS Lightsail.

## Codebreaker: Puzzle Game

> A classic "guess the code" puzzle game where the player attempts to break a randomly generated four-digit code. The player is given four attempts to guess the code and win the game! This project is a full-stack web application exercise designed to generate puzzles and retain statistics. It was refactored to be entirely JavaScript for static hosting purposes, with game statistics recorded in browser local storage.

## AI Agents: Playing Super Mario Bros. with AI

> This project involves the implementation of a Rule-Based Agent and a Reinforcement-Learning Agent (PPO) to play Super Mario Bros., along with a comparison of their performances. It utilizes object detection to determine rule-based actions and incorporates StableBaseline3's PPO Algorithm and CNN Policy for reinforcement learning.
